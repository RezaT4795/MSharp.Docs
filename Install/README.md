## How to install

3. Open your Visual Studio as ADMINSTRATOR (It's recommended that you make this the default.)

## Create your first application

1. In Visual Studio, click to create a new project.
2. On the left hand side, select ".NET Core" as the category.
3. On the right hand side, select "M# - ASP.NET Core" as the template type.
4. Click Create. On the next page accept the default and click Create again.
5. Set Website as your start-up project.
6. Run the app to see the login page.

### Note

>At this stage, it will download the latest project template [from here](https://github.com/Geeksltd/Olive.MvcTemplate) and replace the name placeholder with your specified app name. It will also run the Initialize.bat file from the solution root directory which will install bower, packages, etc.

## Troubleshooting

If you experienced any problem try the following:

1. Open a cmd and run Initialize.bat file and watch for errors. You might have missing components.
2. Make sure all nuget packages are successfully restored.
3. If your package did not restore correctly, remove the .nuget contents folder from `C:\Users\{YOUR USER NAME}`
4. Make sure that the path to the solution is not too long or it does not contain special characters such as space.
5. If you had any kind of difficulties and unexpected problems or you faced with M#/Olive template issues, just leave an issue [HERE](https://github.com/Geeksltd/Olive.MvcTemplate/issues).
